# What are LPMs?

They are addons for LilCoders that are not built in features at the moment but can be added with the plugin function.

# How can I make one?

They are just javascript functions made with the canvas API. Send us a PR with the LPM if you do!

# Examples?

[Shapes](https://github.com/LilCoders/LPMs/blob/master/shapes.lpm)

# Anything else?

* LPMs could become a built-in feature in a future update.
* There will be a page deticated to approved LPMs.
* Any unaproved LPMs that can harm or be innapropriate will be banned.
